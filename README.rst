Overview
========

Perform one or more actions if someone performed a login, e.g. to the
admin interface. This is based on django-axes.
Currently implemented action is to send a notification mail to the site admins.


Dependencies
============

* `django_axes` (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-axes/)


Installation
============

- Install:

    pip install django-axes-login-action

- Add `axes_login_action` to `INSTALLED_APPS`


Usage
=====

On any login recognized by `django-axes`, `django-axes-login-actions` executes
the configured actions.
By default, a notification mail is sent to the configured site admins (
see Django's `ADMINS` setting). This is handled in `axes_login_actions.actions.email.notify`.

You can add or replace the default action with custom actions if you like.
To do so, set the setting `AXES_LOGIN_ACTIONS` to a list of paths to any callable
function or class.
Each configured action is called with a positional argument `instance` which is
a `axes.models.AccessAttempt` instance and the same kwargs as sent by the Django
`django.db.models.signals.post_save` signal.
